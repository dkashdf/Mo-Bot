            <p>Mo bot is a drum bot. And there are many commands available to use these commands as you want within your server. As long as what you're doing doesn't break the TOS of Discord.</p>
            <p>Mo bot stores channelIDs, guildIDs. We store such IDs only if the bot needs to run on your server. If you want to delete your data, remove the bot from your server. You can also join our support server to request deletion of your personal data. We will be happy to delete it for you.</p>
